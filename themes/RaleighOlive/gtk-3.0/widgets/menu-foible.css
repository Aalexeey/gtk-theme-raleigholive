/*
 * XXX:
 *
 * For some whack-a-doodle reason, when you add padding to a menu which is
 * too large to fit entirely on-screen, the top "panning arrow button" looks
 * just fine, but the bottom one has some unknown type of spacing applied
 * to it.  It's not padding, it's not a margin, and it doesn't seem to be
 * border-related; I get the impression it's yet another GTK bug.  Specifically,
 * the mysterious spacing in question is a block of transparent space at the
 * bottom of the pan down button (or, you could say negative space at the top
 * of the button), and its height is always equal to double the menu's bottom
 * padding.  Weird.
 *
 * Yes, this is an ugly hack to get rid of the spacing, but I don't know any
 * other way to remove the spacing.
