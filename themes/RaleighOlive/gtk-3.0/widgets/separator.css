/*
 * A special case for the separator between two sides of a paned widget.
 *
 * This kind of separator really has very little to do with the separator
 * above.  In fact, we have to unset many properties, including the border.
 * This kind of separator includes a centered background image of seven dots
 * to show that the separator can be dragged.
 *
 * XXX:  Due to a GTK+ bug, centered backgrounds are aligned at the true center
 * of a widget / CSS node even if one or both dimensions of the node are odd
 * numbers.  Therefore, the background image will be blurred if the paned
 * widget is an odd number of pixels tall.  There appears to be no workaround
 * for this bug as of yet.
